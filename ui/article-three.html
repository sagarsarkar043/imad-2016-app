<h1>INDIAN OPEN </h1>

<p>

The India Open (officially titled as the Yonex-Sunrise India Open) is an annual badminton event which has been held in India since 2008.

Its inaugural edition was to be held in Hyderabad in 2007. But it was cancelled due to the 25 August 2007 Hyderabad bombings.

Its first three editions were designated as Grand Prix Gold events.

In 2011, it was upgraded to the BWF Superseries tournament.

Since then, it has been held annually at the Siri Fort Sports Complex, New Delhi.
