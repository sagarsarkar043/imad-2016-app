<p class="str1">

Once there was a lark singing in the forest. A farmer came by with a box full of worms .The lark stopped and asked him-‚Äúwhat do you have in the box and where are you going.<br>
The farmer replied that he had worms and was going to the market to sell them for feathers .The lark said-‚Äù I have many feathers , i will pluck one and give it to  you and that will save me looking for worms.‚Ä<br>ù 
The farmer  gave the worms to the lark  and lark plucked a feather and give it in return.The next day  the same thing happened and the day after and on and on until a day came when the lark had no more feathers.<br>
Now it could no longer fly to go for hunting for worms.It started looking ugly and stopped singing and very soon died.

<br>
Moral- what the lark thought  was an easy task to get food turned out to be tougher way after all.
