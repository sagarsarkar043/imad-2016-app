<p class="arti1">

Once there was a lark singing in the forest. A farmer came by with a box full of worms .The lark stopped and asked him-“what do you have in the box and where are you going.
The farmer replied that he had worms and was going to the market to sell them for feathers .The lark said-” I have many feathers , i will pluck one and give it to  you and that will save me looking for worms.” 
The farmer  gave the worms to the lark  and lark plucked a feather and give it in return.The next day  the same thing happened and the day after and on and on until a day came when the lark had no more feathers.
Now it could no longer fly to go for hunting for worms.It started looking ugly and stopped singing and very soon died.
